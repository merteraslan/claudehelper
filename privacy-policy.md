# Privacy Policy for Claude Helper

Last updated: [23 - Jul - 2024]

## Introduction

Claude Helper is a browser extension designed to enhance the functionality of Claude AI by allowing bulk folder uploads and quick project resets. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you feel confident while using our extension.

## Data Handling and Transmission

Claude Helper is designed with privacy in mind. We want to be clear about our data practices:

1. **Limited Data Transmission**: Claude Helper does not collect or store any user data. However, when you use the bulk upload feature, the extension does transmit the contents of your selected files to Claude AI. This transmission is necessary for the core functionality of the extension.

2. **Local Operation**: All functions of the extension operate entirely within your browser and the Claude AI environment. No data is sent to any servers other than Claude AI's.

3. **File Handling**: When you use the bulk upload feature, the extension temporarily reads the contents of your selected files in your browser's memory. This data is then transmitted directly to your Claude AI project. The extension does not retain this data after the upload is complete.

4. **No External Servers**: Your data is only transmitted to Claude AI's servers. The extension does not send data to any third-party servers or services.

5. **No Authentication Data**: The extension works with your existing Claude AI login and does not require or store any additional authentication information.

6. **Respecting Claude AI's File Restrictions**: The extension adheres to Claude AI's existing file upload restrictions. Unsupported file types will be skipped during folder uploads and not transmitted.

## Third-Party Services

Claude Helper does not integrate with or use any third-party services or analytics tools.

## Changes to the Project or Claude AI Platform

As Claude Helper is designed to work with the Claude AI platform, changes to Claude AI may affect the functionality of our extension. We will strive to update Claude Helper as necessary to maintain compatibility and security.

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
