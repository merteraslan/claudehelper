# Claude Helper

Streamline your project knowledge management in Claude AI with the Claude Helper extension!

## What It Does

Claude Helper enhances your Claude AI experience by adding two much needed features:

1. **Bulk Folder Upload**: Easily upload entire folders to your Claude AI projects with a single click and add multiple files at once.

2. **Quick Project Reset**: Remove all uploaded files from your project instantly, allowing you to start fresh or update your project knowledge base in seconds.

## Key Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Works directly within your Claude AI interface for a smooth user experience.
- **Page-Specific Functionality**: The extension's buttons appear only on Claude AI project pages (URLs containing '/project/'), ensuring a clean interface throughout the rest of your Claude AI experience.
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback on upload and removal progress keeps you informed.
- **Error Handling**: Clear messages for any upload or removal issues, helping troubleshoot issues.
- **Time-Saving**: Dramatically reduce the time spent managing your project files.

## How It Works

Claude Helper adds two intuitive buttons to your Claude AI project page:

- **Upload Folders**: Click to select and upload entire folders to your project.
- **Remove All Files**: Quickly clear all uploaded files from your project with a single click.

## Data Usage and Privacy

We take your privacy seriously. Here's what you need to know:

- **Zero Data Collection**: This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data outside of the Claude AI platform. It reads file contents solely for uploading to your Claude AI project.
- **Local Operation**: All extension functions operate within your browser, interacting only with the Claude AI platform using your existing session.
- **No External Servers**: Your data never leaves the Claude AI platform. The extension communicates exclusively with Claude AI's servers.
- **No Authentication Required**: The extension works with your existing Claude AI login, requiring no extra credentials.
- **Temporary File Reading**: During the upload process, files are read temporarily in your browser's memory for transmission to Claude AI. This data is not stored or retained by the extension.

## Important Notes

- The extension adheres to Claude AI's existing file upload restrictions. Unsupported file types will be skipped during folder uploads.
- This is a third-party tool and is not officially affiliated with Anthropic or Claude AI.
- The extension only functions on Claude AI project pages and has no access to other websites.
- Always ensure you have backups of important files before bulk removal.
- **Paid Plan Requirement**: Claude AI projects are only available with a paid plan. This extension will not work for users on the free plan as they do not have access to project functionality.
